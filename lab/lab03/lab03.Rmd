# Lab 3: Data Types and Vectors

Welcome to Lab 3!

So far, we've used R to manipulate numbers and work with tables. But we need to discuss data types to deepen our understanding of how to work with data in R.

In this lab, you'll first see how to represent and manipulate another fundamental type of data: text. A piece of text is called a *string* (or character vector) in R. You'll also see how to work with *vectors* of data. A vector could contain all the numbers between 0 and 100 or all the words in the chapter of a book. Lastly, you'll create data frames and practice analyzing them with your knowledge of table operations.


**Submission**: Once you're finished, run all code chunks and verify that they all work, save the file using Ctrl+S or Cmd+S, and knit the document to PDF to create the final output.

Let's begin by setting up the libraries by running the cell below.

```{r libraries}
# Load required libraries
library(utils)  # For read.csv and other utilities
# We'll use base R for most operations, similar to how the Python version uses basic functions
```

# 1. Text

Programming doesn't just concern numbers. Text is one of the most common data types used in programs.

Text is represented by a **character value** in R. The word "string" is a programming term for a sequence of characters. A string might contain a single character, a word, a sentence, or a whole book.

To distinguish text data from actual code, we demarcate strings by putting quotation marks around them. Single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) are both valid, but the types of opening and closing quotation marks must match. The contents can be any sequence of characters, including numbers and symbols.

We've seen strings before in `cat` or `print` statements. Below, two different strings are passed as arguments to the `cat` function. Notice that the `cat` function automatically inserts a space between its two input string arguments (comma separated) in the output of this cell.

```{r text_demo}
cat("I <3", 'Data Science')
```

Just as names can be given to numbers, names can be given to string values. The names and strings aren't required to be similar in any way. Any name can be assigned to any string.

```{r string_assignment}
one <- 'two'
plus <- '*'
cat(one, plus, one)
```

**Question 1.1.** Yuri Gagarin was the first person to travel through outer space. When he emerged from his capsule upon landing on Earth, he [reportedly](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin) had the following conversation with a woman and girl who saw the landing:

```         
The woman asked: "Can it be that you have come from outer space?"
Gagarin replied: "As a matter of fact, I have!"
```

The cell below contains unfinished code. Fill in the missing values so that it prints out this conversation *exactly* as it appears above.

Hint: Examine how `woman_quote` is defined to include the double quotes.

```{r q11}
woman_asking <- "The woman asked:"
woman_quote <- '"Can it be that you have come from outer space?"'
gagarin_reply <- 'Gagarin replied:'
gagarin_quote <- 'As a matter of fact, I have!'

cat(woman_asking, woman_quote, "\n")
cat(gagarin_reply, gagarin_quote)
```

```{r q11_test}
# Test: Check if the strings are correct
if (woman_asking == "The woman asked:" && gagarin_quote == '"As a matter of fact, I have!"') {
  cat("✓ Test passed: Conversation strings are correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: Check your string assignments")
}
```

## 1.1. String Functions

Strings can be transformed using **functions**. In R, we have many built-in functions for string manipulation.

Here's a sketch of how to call functions on a string:

```         
<function name>(<string>, <argument>, <argument>, ...)
```

One example of a string function is `gsub`, which replaces all instances of some part of the original string (or a *substring*) with a new string.

```         
gsub(<old substring>, <new substring>, <original string>)
```

`gsub` returns (evaluates to) a new string, leaving the original string unchanged.

Try to predict the output of this example, then run the cell!

```{r string_replace}
# Replace one letter
bag <- 'bag'
result <- gsub('g', 't', bag)
cat(result, bag)
```

You can call functions on the results of other functions. For example, `max(abs(-5), abs(3))` evaluates to 5. Similarly, you can call functions on the results of other function calls.

```{r chained_functions}
# Calling gsub on the output of another call to gsub
gsub('in', 'de', gsub('t', 'ing', 'train'))
```

Here's a picture of how R evaluates a "chained" function call like that:

<img src="chaining_method_calls.png"/>

**Question 1.1.1.** Use `gsub` to transform the string `'hitchhiker'` into `'matchmaker'`. Assign your result to `new_word`.

```{r q111}
new_word <- gsub('', '', 'hitchhiker')
new_word
```

```{r q111_test}
# Test: Should equal 'matchmaker'
if (new_word == 'matchmaker') {
  cat("✓ Test passed: new_word =", new_word)
} else {
  stop("Test failed: new_word =", new_word)
}
```

There are many more string functions in R, but most programmers don't memorize their names or how to use them. In the "real world," people usually just search the internet for documentation and examples. A complete list of string functions appears in the R documentation. [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) has a huge database of answered questions that often demonstrate how to use these functions to achieve various ends.

## 1.2. Converting to and from Strings

Strings and numbers are different *types* of values, even when a string contains the digits of a number. For example, evaluating the following cell causes an error because an integer cannot be added to a string.

```{r string_number_error, error=TRUE}
8 + "8"
```

However, there are built-in functions to convert numbers to strings and strings to numbers. Some of these built-in functions have restrictions on the type of argument they take:

| Function | Description |
|----|----|
| `as.integer` | Converts a string of digits or a float to an integer value |
| `as.numeric` | Converts a string of digits (perhaps with a decimal point) to a decimal (numeric) value |
| `as.character` | Converts any value to a string |

Try to predict what data type and value `example` evaluates to, then run the cell.

```{r type_conversion}
example <- 8 + as.integer("10") + as.numeric("8")

print(example)
cat("This example returned a", class(example), "!")
```

Suppose you're writing a program that looks for dates in a text, and you want your program to find the amount of time that elapsed between two years it has identified. It doesn't make sense to subtract two texts, but you can first convert the text containing the years into numbers.

**Question 1.2.1.** Finish the code below to compute the number of years that elapsed between `one_year` and `another_year`. Don't just write the numbers `1618` and `1648` (or `30`); use a conversion function to turn the given text data into numbers.

```{r q121}
# Some text data:
one_year <- "1618"
another_year <- "1648"

# Complete the next line. Note that we can't just write:
#   another_year - one_year
# If you don't see why, try seeing what happens when you
# write that here.
difference <- 0
difference
```

```{r q121_test}
# Test: Should equal 30
if (abs(difference) == 30 || abs(difference) == 30.0) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: difference =", difference)
} else {
  stop("Test failed: difference =", difference)
}
```

## 1.3. Passing strings to functions

String values, like numbers, can be arguments to functions and can be returned by functions.

The function `nchar` (derived from "number of characters") takes a single string as its argument and returns the number of characters (including spaces) in the string.

Note that it doesn't count *words*. `nchar("one small step for man")` evaluates to 22 characters, not 5 words.

**Question 1.3.1.** Use `nchar` to find the number of characters in the long string in the next cell. Characters include things like spaces and punctuation. Assign `sentence_length` to that number.

(The string is the first sentence of the English translation of the French [Declaration of the Rights of Man](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/rightsof.asp).)

```{r q131}
a_very_long_sentence <- "The representatives of the French people, organized as a National Assembly, believing that the ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and of the corruption of governments, have determined to set forth in a solemn declaration the natural, unalienable, and sacred rights of man, in order that this declaration, being constantly before all the members of the Social body, shall remind them continually of their rights and duties; in order that the acts of the legislative power, as well as those of the executive power, may be compared at any moment with the objects and purposes of all political institutions and may thus be more respected, and, lastly, in order that the grievances of the citizens, based hereafter upon simple and incontestable principles, shall tend to the maintenance of the constitution and redound to the happiness of all."
sentence_length <- 0
sentence_length
```

```{r q131_test}
# Test: Should equal 896
if (sentence_length == 896) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: sentence_length =", sentence_length)
} else {
  stop("Test failed: sentence_length =", sentence_length)
}
```

# 2. Vectors

Computers are most useful when you can use a small amount of code to *do the same action* to *many different things*.

For example, in the time it takes you to calculate the 18% tip on a restaurant bill, a laptop can calculate 18% tips for every restaurant bill paid by every human on Earth that day. (That's if you're pretty fast at doing arithmetic in your head!)

**Vectors** are how we put many values in one place so that we can operate on them as a group. For example, if `billions_of_numbers` is a vector of numbers, the expression

```         
0.18 * billions_of_numbers
```

gives a new vector of numbers that contains the result of multiplying **each number** in `billions_of_numbers` by 0.18. Vectors are not limited to numbers; we can also put all the words in a book into a vector of strings.

Concretely, a vector is a **collection of values of the same type**.

## 2.1. Making vectors

First, let's learn how to manually input values into a vector. This typically isn't how programs work. Normally, we create vectors by loading them from an external source, like a data file.

To create a vector by hand, call the function `c` (for "combine"). Each argument you pass to `c` will be in the vector it returns. Run this cell to see an example:

```{r vector_creation}
c(0.125, 4.75, -1.3)
```

Each value in a vector (in the above case, the numbers 0.125, 4.75, and -1.3) is called an *element* of that vector.

Vectors themselves are also values, just like numbers and strings. That means you can assign them to names or use them as arguments to functions. For example, `length(<some_vector>)` returns the number of elements in `some_vector`.

**Question 2.1.1.** Make a vector containing the numbers 0, 1, -1, and π, in that order. Name it `interesting_numbers`.

*Hint:* How did you get the value π in lab 2? You can refer to it the same way here. We can use `pi` which is built into R.

```{r q211}
interesting_numbers <- 0
interesting_numbers
```

```{r q211_test}
# Test: Check the vector
expected <- c(0, 1, -1, pi)
if (all(interesting_numbers == expected) && length(interesting_numbers) == 4) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: interesting_numbers is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: interesting_numbers is incorrect")
}
```

**Question 2.1.2.** Make a vector containing the five strings `"Hello"`, `","`, `" "`, `"world"`, and `"!"`. (The third one is a single space inside quotes.) Name it `hello_world_components`.

```{r q212}
hello_world_components <- 0
hello_world_components
```

```{r q212_test}
# Test: Check the vector
expected <- c("Hello", ",", " ", "world", "!")
if (all(hello_world_components == expected) && length(hello_world_components) == 5) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: hello_world_components is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: hello_world_components is incorrect")
}
```

### `seq()` - Creating sequences

Very often in data science, we want to work with many numbers that are evenly spaced within some range. R provides a special function for this called `seq`. The function call `seq(start, stop, by)` evaluates to a vector with all the numbers starting at `start` and counting up by `by`, stopping at or before `stop` is reached.

Run the following cells to see some examples!

```{r seq_examples}
# This vector starts at 1 and counts up by 2
# and then stops at or before 6
seq(1, 6, by = 2)
```

```{r seq_examples2}
# This vector contains 9
# because seq stops at the stop value
seq(4, 9, by = 1)
```

```{r seq_examples3}
# This vector defaults to increment by 1
# You can also use the shorthand notation for integer sequences
0:5
```

**Question 2.1.3.** Use `seq` to create a vector with the multiples of 99 from 0 up to (**and including**) 9999. (So its elements are 0, 99, 198, 297, etc.)

```{r q213}
multiples_of_99 <- 0
multiples_of_99
```

```{r q213_test}
# Test: Check the vector
if (length(multiples_of_99) == 102 && all(multiples_of_99 == seq(0, 9999, by = 99))) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: multiples_of_99 is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: multiples_of_99 is incorrect")
}
```

## 2.2. Working with single elements of vectors ("indexing")

Let's work with a more interesting dataset. The next cell creates a vector called `population_amounts` that includes estimated world populations of every year from **1950** to roughly the present. (The estimates come from the US Census Bureau website.)

Rather than type in the data manually, we've loaded them from a file on your computer called `world_population.csv`. You'll learn how to do that later in this lab!

```{r load_population}
population_amounts <- read.csv('world_population.csv')$Population
population_amounts
```

Here's how we get the first element of `population_amounts`, which is the world population in the first year in the dataset, 1950.

```{r indexing_first}
population_amounts[1]
```

The value of that expression is the number 2,557,628,654 (around 2.5 billion), because that's the first thing in the vector `population_amounts`.

Notice that we wrote `[1]`, not `[0]`, to get the first element. This is different from Python! **In R, 1 is the index of the first item.** It's the position of that item. So 4 is the index of the 4th item.

Here are some more examples. In the examples, we've given names to the things we get out of `population_amounts`. Read and run each cell.

```{r indexing_examples}
# The 13th element in the vector is the population
# in 1962 (which is 1950 + 12).
population_1962 <- population_amounts[13]
population_1962
```

```{r indexing_examples2}
# The 66th element is the population in 2015.
population_2015 <- population_amounts[66]
population_2015
```

```{r indexing_error, error=TRUE}
# The vector has only 66 elements, so this doesn't work.
# (There's no element at position 67.)
population_2016 <- population_amounts[67]
population_2016
```

Since `c` returns a vector, we can access its elements using indexing, just like we did with `population_amounts`.

```{r chained_indexing}
c(-1, -3, 4, -2)[4]
```

**Question 2.2.1.** Set `population_1973` to the world population in 1973, by getting the appropriate element from `population_amounts` using indexing.

```{r q221}
population_1973 <-0 # 1973 is 1950 + 23, so index 24
population_1973
```

```{r q221_test}
# Test: Should equal 3942096442
if (population_1973 == 3942096442) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: population_1973 =", population_1973)
} else {
  stop("Test failed: population_1973 =", population_1973)
}
```

## 2.3. Doing something to every element of a vector

Vectors are primarily useful for doing the same operation many times, so we don't often have to use indexing and work with single elements.

### Rounding

Here is one simple question we might ask about world population:

> How big was the population in each year, rounded to the nearest million?

Rounding is often used with large numbers when we don't need as much precision in our numbers. One example of this is when we present data in tables and visualizations.

We could try to answer our question using the `round` function that is built into R and the indexing you just saw.

**Note:** the `round` function takes in two arguments: the number to be rounded, and the number of decimal places to round to. The second argument can be thought of as how many steps right or left you move from the decimal point. Negative numbers tell us to move left, and positive numbers tell us to move right. So, if we have `round(1234.5, -2)`, it means that we should move two places left, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 1200. On the other hand, if we have `round(6.789, 1)`, we should move one place right, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 6.8.

```{r manual_rounding}
population_1950_magnitude <- round(population_amounts[1], -6)
population_1951_magnitude <- round(population_amounts[2], -6)
population_1952_magnitude <- round(population_amounts[3], -6)
population_1953_magnitude <- round(population_amounts[4], -6)
```

But this is tedious and doesn't really take advantage of the fact that we are using a computer.

Instead, R's `round` function can work on entire vectors at once! It takes in two arguments: a vector of numbers, and the number of decimal places to round to. It returns a vector of the same length, where each element of the result is the corresponding element of the argument rounded.

**Question 2.3.1.** Use `round` to compute the world population in every year, rounded to the nearest million (6 zeroes). Give the result (a vector of 66 numbers) the name `population_rounded`. Your code should be very short.

```{r q231}
population_rounded <- 0
population_rounded
```

```{r q231_test}
# Test: Check that it's a vector and has the right numbers
if (is.vector(population_rounded) && sum(population_rounded) == 312868000000) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: population_rounded is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: population_rounded is incorrect")
}
```

What you just did is called **elementwise** application of `round`, since `round` operates separately on each element of the vector that it's called on. Here's a picture of what's going on:

<img src="array_round.jpg"/>

### Arithmetic

Arithmetic also works elementwise on vectors, meaning that if you perform an arithmetic operation (like subtraction, division, etc) on a vector, R will do the operation to every element of the vector individually and return a vector of all of the results. For example, you can divide all the population numbers by 1 billion to get numbers in billions:

```{r vector_arithmetic}
population_in_billions <- population_amounts / 1000000000
population_in_billions
```

You can do the same with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation (`^` or `**`).

## 3. Creating Data Frames

A vector is useful for describing a single attribute of each element in a collection. For example, let's say our collection is all US States. Then a vector could describe the land area of each state.

Data frames extend this idea by containing multiple columns stored as vectors, each one describing a different attribute for every element of a collection. In this way, data frames allow us to not only store data about many entities but to also contain several kinds of data about each entity.

For example, in the cell below we have two vectors. The first one, `population_amounts`, was defined above in section 2.2 and contains the world population in each year (estimated by the US Census Bureau). The second vector, `years`, contains the years themselves. These elements are in order, so the year and the world population for that year have the same index in their corresponding vectors.

```{r create_vectors}
# Just run this cell

years <- 1950:2015
cat("Population column:", head(population_amounts), "...\n")
cat("Years column:", head(years), "...\n")
```

Suppose we want to answer this question:

> In which year did the world's population cross 6 billion?

You could technically answer this question just from staring at the vectors, but it's a bit convoluted, since you would have to count the position where the population first crossed 6 billion, then find the corresponding element in the years vector. In cases like these, it might be easier to put the data into a *data frame*, a 2-dimensional type of dataset.

The expression below:

-   creates a data frame using the function `data.frame()`,
-   adds two columns by providing named arguments (corresponding to the name of the column and the values for that column),
-   assigns the result to the name `population`, and finally
-   evaluates `population` so that we can see the data frame.

The strings `"Year"` and `"Population"` are column labels that we have chosen. The names `population_amounts` and `years` were assigned above to two vectors of the **same length**.

```{r create_dataframe}
population <- data.frame(
    Population = population_amounts,
    Year = years
)
head(population)
```

Now the data is combined into a single data frame! It's much easier to parse this data. If you need to know what the population was in 1959, for example, you can tell from a single glance.

**Question 3.1.** In the cell below, we've created 2 vectors. Using the steps above, assign `top_10_movies` to a data frame that has two columns called "Name" and "Rating", which hold `top_10_movie_names` and `top_10_movie_ratings` respectively.

```{r q31}
top_10_movie_names <- c(
        'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)',
        'The Godfather (1972)',
        'The Godfather: Part II (1974)',
        'Pulp Fiction (1994)',
        "Schindler's List (1993)",
        'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)',
        '12 Angry Men (1957)',
        'The Dark Knight (2008)',
        'Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966)',
        'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)')
top_10_movie_ratings <- c(9.2, 9.2, 9.0, 8.9, 8.9, 8.9, 8.9, 8.9, 8.9, 8.8)

top_10_movies <- data.frame(
    Name = top_10_movie_names,
    Rating = top_10_movie_ratings
)

# We've put this next line here 
# so your data frame will get printed out 
# when you run this cell.
top_10_movies
```

```{r q31_test}
# Test: Check the data frame structure
if (is.data.frame(top_10_movies) && 
    all(names(top_10_movies) == c("Name", "Rating")) &&
    nrow(top_10_movies) == 10) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: top_10_movies data frame is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: top_10_movies data frame structure is incorrect")
}
```

#### Loading a data frame from a file

In most cases, we aren't going to go through the trouble of typing in all the data manually. Instead, we load them in from an external source, like a data file. There are many formats for data files, but CSV ("comma-separated values") is the most common.

`read.csv(...)` takes one argument (a path to a data file in **string** format) and returns a data frame.

**Question 3.2.** `imdb.csv` contains a data frame of information about the 250 highest-rated movies on IMDb. Load it as a data frame called `imdb`.

(You may remember working with this table in Lab 2!)

```{r q32}
imdb <- read.csv('imdb.csv')
head(imdb)
```

```{r q32_test}
# Test: Check the data frame
if (is.data.frame(imdb) && nrow(imdb) == 250) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: imdb data frame loaded correctly")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: imdb data frame not loaded correctly")
}
```

Where did `imdb.csv` come from? Take a look at this lab's folder. You should see a file called `imdb.csv`.

Open up the `imdb.csv` file in that folder and look at the format. What do you notice? The `.csv` filename ending says that this file is in the [CSV (comma-separated value) format](http://edoceo.com/utilitas/csv-file-format).

## 4. More Data Frame Operations!

Now that you've worked with vectors, let's add a few more operations to the list of data frame operations that you saw in Lab 2.

### Column Access

You can access a column of a data frame using the `$` operator or square brackets:

```{r column_access}
# Returns a vector of movie names
head(top_10_movies$Name)
```

### Subsetting Rows

You can subset rows of a data frame using square brackets with logical conditions:

```{r row_subset}
# Take first 5 movies of top_10_movies
top_10_movies[1:5, ]
```

The next three questions will give you practice with combining the operations you've learned in this lab and the previous one to answer questions about the `population` and `imdb` data frames. First, check out the `population` data frame from section 3.

```{r display_population}
# Run this cell to display the population data frame.
head(population)
```

**Question 4.1.** Check out the `population` data frame from section 3 of this lab. Compute the year when the world population first went above 6 billion. Assign the year to `year_population_crossed_6_billion`.

*Hint:* How can we filter the data frame to only rows with population values over 6 billion? How can we find the first year of this filtered data frame?

```{r q41}
above_6_billion <- 0
year_population_crossed_6_billion <- 0
year_population_crossed_6_billion
```

```{r q41_test}
# Test: Should equal 1999
if (year_population_crossed_6_billion == 1999) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: year_population_crossed_6_billion =", year_population_crossed_6_billion)
} else {
  stop("Test failed: year_population_crossed_6_billion =", year_population_crossed_6_billion)
}
```

**Question 4.2.** Find the average rating for movies released before the year 2000 and the average rating for movies released in the year 2000 or after for the movies in `imdb`.

*Hint*: Think of the steps you need to do (take the average, find the ratings, find movies released in 20th/21st centuries), and try to put them in an order that makes sense.

```{r q42}
before_2000 <- 0
after_or_in_2000 <- 0
before_2000_avg <- 0
after_or_in_2000_avg <-0
cat("Average before 2000 rating:", before_2000_avg, "\n")
cat("Average after or in 2000 rating:", after_or_in_2000_avg, "\n")
```

```{r q42_test}
# Test: Check the averages
if (abs(before_2000_avg - 8.2783625730994146) < 1e-5 && 
    abs(after_or_in_2000_avg - 8.2379746835443033) < 1e-5) {

**Question 4.3.** Here's a challenge: Find the number of movies that came out in *even* years.

*Hint:* The operator `%%` computes the remainder when dividing by a number. So `5 %% 2` is 1 and `6 %% 2` is 0. A number is even if the remainder is 0 when you divide by 2.

*Hint 2:* `%%` can be used on vectors, operating elementwise like `+` or `*`. So `c(5, 6, 7) %% 2` is `c(1, 0, 1)`.

*Hint 3:* Add a new column called "Year_Remainder" that's the remainder when each movie's release year is divided by 2. Then, filter to find rows where that new column is equal to 0. Finally, count the number of such rows using `nrow()`.

```{r q43}
imdb$Year_Remainder <- 0
even_year_movies <- 0
num_even_year_movies <- 0 
num_even_year_movies
```

```{r q43_test}
# Test: Should equal 127
if (num_even_year_movies == 127) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: num_even_year_movies =", num_even_year_movies)
} else {
  stop("Test failed: num_even_year_movies =", num_even_year_movies)
}
```

## 5. More Vector Practice

The following questions will be great practice for learning how to generate vectors in different ways, as well as executing different methods of vector arithmetic!

### 5.1 `seq()` (cont.)

##### Temperature readings

NOAA (the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) operates weather stations that measure surface temperatures at different sites around the United States. The hourly readings are [publicly available](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/qclcd/QCLCD?prior=N).

Suppose we download all the hourly data from the Oakland, California site for the month of December 2015. To analyze the data, we want to know when each reading was taken, but we find that the data don't include the timestamps of the readings (the time at which each one was taken).

However, we know the first reading was taken at the first instant of December 2015 (midnight on December 1st) and each subsequent reading was taken exactly 1 hour after the last.

**Question 5.1.1.** Create a vector of the *time, in seconds, since the start of the month* at which **each hourly reading** was taken. Name it `collection_times`.

*Hint 1:* There were 31 days in December, which is equivalent to (31 × 24) hours or (31 × 24 × 60 × 60) seconds. So your vector should have 31 × 24 elements in it.

*Hint 2:* The `length` function works on vectors, too! If your `collection_times` isn't passing the tests, check its length and make sure it has 31 × 24 elements.

```{r q511}
collection_times <- 0
collection_times
```

```{r q511_test}
# Test: Check the vector
if (length(collection_times) == 744 && 
    collection_times[13] == 43200 && 
    collection_times[38] == 133200) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: collection_times is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: collection_times is incorrect")
}
```

### 5.2 Doing something to every element of a vector (cont.)

Calculate a tip on several restaurant bills at once (in this case just 3):

```{r tip_calculation}
restaurant_bills <- c(20.12, 39.90, 31.01)
tip_percentage <- 0.2
cat("Restaurant bills:\t", restaurant_bills, "\n")

# Vector multiplication
tips <- 0
cat("Tips:\t\t\t", tips, "\n")
```

<img src="array_multiplication.jpg"/>

**Question 5.2.1** Suppose the total charge at a restaurant is the original bill plus the tip. If the tip is 20%, that means we can multiply the original bill by 1.2 to get the total charge. Compute the total charge for each bill in `restaurant_bills`, and assign the resulting vector to `total_charges`.

```{r q521}
total_charges <- 0
total_charges
```

```{r q521_test}
# Test: Check the vector
expected <- c(24.144, 47.88, 37.212)
if (all(abs(total_charges - expected) < 1e-6)) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: total_charges is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: total_charges is incorrect")
}
```

**Question 5.2.2.** The vector `more_restaurant_bills` contains 100,000 bills! Compute the total charge for each one in `more_restaurant_bills`. How is your code different?

```{r q522}
more_restaurant_bills <- read.csv("more_restaurant_bills.csv")$Bill
more_total_charges <- 0
head(more_total_charges)
```

```{r q522_test}
# Test: Check the vector
if (all(abs(more_total_charges - 1.2 * more_restaurant_bills) < 1e-6)) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: more_total_charges is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: more_total_charges is incorrect")
}
```

The function `sum` takes a single vector of numbers as its argument. It returns the sum of all the numbers in that vector (so it returns a single number, not a vector).

**Question 5.2.3.** What was the sum of all the bills in `more_restaurant_bills`, *including tips*?

```{r q523}
sum_of_bills <- 0
sum_of_bills
```

```{r q523_test}
# Test: Check the sum
if (round(sum_of_bills, 2) == 1795730.06) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: sum_of_bills =", sum_of_bills)
} else {
  stop("Test failed: sum_of_bills =", sum_of_bills)
}
```

**Question 5.2.4.** The powers of 2 (2\^0 = 1, 2\^1 = 2, 2\^2 = 4, etc) arise frequently in computer science. (For example, you may have noticed that storage on smartphones or USBs come in powers of 2, like 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB.) Use `seq` or `:` and the exponentiation operator `^` to compute the first 30 powers of 2, starting from `2^0`.

*Hint 1:* Creating a sequence from 1 to 2\^30 will create a vector with 2\^30 elements and **will crash your R session**.

*Hint 2:* Part of your solution will involve creating a sequence, but your vector shouldn't have more than 30 elements.

```{r q524}
powers_of_2 <- 0
powers_of_2
```

```{r q524_test}
# Test: Check the vector
if (all(powers_of_2 == 2^(0:29))) {
  cat("✓ Test passed: powers_of_2 is correct")
} else {
  stop("Test failed: powers_of_2 is incorrect")
}
```
